I wasn't satisfied with the available Text to Mindmap tools out there so I decided to try and make one using SvelteKit and Tailwind. Styling the items linking is difficult but the rest works.

The way it works is that it generates a Mind Map off of [a JavaScript object](https://github.com/asty8926/Text-to-Mindmap/blob/master/src/lib/mindMapData.js) in HTML.
